            <p class="mt-10 text-xl">we are started this process through our third year of engineering.This a business just developed to help college students with their laptop services which they think diffifult and are not cheap.we offer prices which you have never seen before, we thought of it because college students struggle with their money,and are forced to spent them on various means of fees to the college,so me mylself Tharun and vishnuvel we offer laptop services for lower cost.our idea kick started when we first opened and cleaned vishnu's laptop and cleaned its fan.After one by one we asked for their laptops and cleaned their fans and discovered new things in their laptops like the placement of slots like RAM,SSD,HDD etc,we also offered them advice on what and all upgrades they can make.This was our story.And we thought that we could gain more reach by creating a website so anyone with any kind of service related to their laptop can contact us or go on to the services page and fill out the google form and we will reach you as soon as possible.The pricing for each task is mentioned clearly in our services page.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center mt-auto mb-auto text-2xl">This is the pic of servicing our friends laptop,It was a hp pavillion ,it had two ram solts but one was filled with a 8 gig card and cooper heat sinks.Right next to it was its ssd,His laptop was more different from my laptop while mine had two ssd slots whereas his had a ssd slot and a hdd slot,which i told him to rush and buy it cause hdd were cheaper then ssd and adivced him to just use it as a external storage and not as a primary boot memory device,Cause ssd are more faster than hdd's.After discovery we removed his fan and cleaned his gooch filled fan,carefully inserted its wires and screwed them.This was our starting of our business of servicing laptops.
